    "In the small city of Brandenburg, Germany, in 2050, community living has become the norm as residents work together to face the challenges of climate change. They share resources, grow food collectively, and hold regular neighborhood feasts to strengthen their bond. One evening, during a communal meal, they discover that one potato is missing from the shared pot. Although it might seem insignificant, this missing potato creates tension within the community, as they begin to question each other's trust and loyalty.\n",
